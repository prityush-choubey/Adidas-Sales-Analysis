# Adidas Sales Analysis (Python & Power BI)
End-to-end sales and profitability analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of Adidas sales data to evaluate sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency across products, regions, retailers, and sales channels.

Python was used for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by Power BI for interactive dashboarding and business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
:- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
:- **Power BI**: DAX, Data Modeling, Interactive Dashboards  
:- **Excel / CSV**: Data source handling

##  Data Analysis Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas  
2. Feature engineering (profit per unit, time-based features, efficiency metrics)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
4. Business and operations analysis using SQL-style aggregations  
5. Interactive dashboard development in Power BI using DAX
